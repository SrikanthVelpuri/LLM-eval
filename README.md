# LLM-eval
Evalutation of LLMs in production

## Primary Goals for Evaluating LLM in Production
The primary goals for evaluating the LLM in production include:
- Latency
- Accuracy
- Bias detection

## Metrics to Measure Goals
To measure these goals, the following metrics will be used:
- BLEU score
- Response time
- Hallucination rate

## Baseline Thresholds for Metrics
The baseline thresholds for these metrics are established as follows:
- BLEU score: 0.7
- Response time: 200ms
- Hallucination rate: 5%
